# Speaking-Dictionary
This Python project utilizes pyttsx3 for speech output, speech_recognition for voice input, and PyDictionary for word meanings. Users initiate by saying "Hello" to activate the dictionary. The bot recognizes words, retrieves meanings, and speaks results, enhancing user interaction with spoken commands.
